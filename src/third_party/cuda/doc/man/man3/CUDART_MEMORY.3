.SS "\fBcudaError_t\fP cudaHostAlloc (void ** pHost, size_t size, unsigned int flags)"
.PP
Allocates \fCsize\fP bytes of host memory that is page-locked and accessible to the device. The driver tracks the virtual memory ranges allocated with this function and automatically accelerates calls to functions such as \fBcudaMemcpy()\fP. Since the memory can be accessed directly by the device, it can be read or written with much higher bandwidth than pageable memory obtained with functions such as malloc(). Allocating excessive amounts of pinned memory may degrade system performance, since it reduces the amount of memory available to the system for paging. As a result, this function is best used sparingly to allocate staging areas for data exchange between host and device.
.PP
The \fCflags\fP parameter enables different options to be specified that affect the allocation, as follows.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBcudaHostAllocDefault\fP: This flag's value is defined to be 0 and causes \fBcudaHostAlloc()\fP to emulate \fBcudaMallocHost()\fP.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBcudaHostAllocPortable\fP: The memory returned by this call will be considered as pinned memory by all CUDA contexts, not just the one that performed the allocation.
.IP "\(bu" 2

Allocates \fCsize\fP bytes of managed memory on the device and returns in \fC*devPtr\fP a pointer to the allocated memory. If the device doesn't support allocating managed memory, \fBcudaErrorNotSupported\fP is returned. Support for managed memory can be queried using the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrManagedMemory\fP. The allocated memory is suitably aligned for any kind of variable. The memory is not cleared. If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fBcudaMallocManaged\fP returns \fBcudaErrorInvalidValue\fP. The pointer is valid on the CPU and on all GPUs in the system that support managed memory. All accesses to this pointer must obey the Unified Memory programming model.
.PP
\fCflags\fP specifies the default stream association for this allocation. \fCflags\fP must be one of \fBcudaMemAttachGlobal\fP or \fBcudaMemAttachHost\fP. The default value for \fCflags\fP is \fBcudaMemAttachGlobal\fP. If \fBcudaMemAttachGlobal\fP is specified, then this memory is accessible from any stream on any device. If \fBcudaMemAttachHost\fP is specified, then the allocation should not be accessed from devices that have a zero value for the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP; an explicit call to \fBcudaStreamAttachMemAsync\fP will be required to enable access on such devices.
.PP
If the association is later changed via \fBcudaStreamAttachMemAsync\fP to a single stream, the default association, as specifed during \fBcudaMallocManaged\fP, is restored when that stream is destroyed. For __managed__ variables, the default association is always \fBcudaMemAttachGlobal\fP. Note that destroying a stream is an asynchronous operation, and as a result, the change to default association won't happen until all work in the stream has completed.
.PP
Memory allocated with \fBcudaMallocManaged\fP should be released with \fBcudaFree\fP.
.PP
Device memory oversubscription is possible for GPUs that have a non-zero value for the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP. Managed memory on such GPUs may be evicted from device memory to host memory at any time by the Unified Memory driver in order to make room for other allocations.
.PP
In a multi-GPU system where all GPUs have a non-zero value for the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP, managed memory may not be populated when this API returns and instead may be populated on access. In such systems, managed memory can migrate to any processor's memory at any time. The Unified Memory driver will employ heuristics to maintain data locality and prevent excessive page faults to the extent possible. The application can also guide the driver about memory usage patterns via \fBcudaMemAdvise\fP. The application can also explicitly migrate memory to a desired processor's memory via \fBcudaMemPrefetchAsync\fP.
.PP
In a multi-GPU system where all of the GPUs have a zero value for the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP and all the GPUs have peer-to-peer support with each other, the physical storage for managed memory is created on the GPU which is active at the time \fBcudaMallocManaged\fP is called. All other GPUs will reference the data at reduced bandwidth via peer mappings over the PCIe bus. The Unified Memory driver does not migrate memory among such GPUs.
.PP
In a multi-GPU system where not all GPUs have peer-to-peer support with each other and where the value of the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP is zero for at least one of those GPUs, the location chosen for physical storage of managed memory is system-dependent.
.IP "\(bu" 2
On Linux, the location chosen will be device memory as long as the current set of active contexts are on devices that either have peer-to-peer support with each other or have a non-zero value for the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP. If there is an active context on a GPU that does not have a non-zero value for that device attribute and it does not have peer-to-peer support with the other devices that have active contexts on them, then the location for physical storage will be 'zero-copy' or host memory. Note that this means that managed memory that is located in device memory is migrated to host memory if a new context is created on a GPU that doesn't have a non-zero value for the device attribute and does not support peer-to-peer with at least one of the other devices that has an active context. This in turn implies that context creation may fail if there is insufficient host memory to migrate all managed allocations.
.IP "\(bu" 2
On Windows, the physical storage is always created in 'zero-copy' or host memory. All GPUs will reference the data at reduced bandwidth over the PCIe bus. In these circumstances, use of the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is recommended to restrict CUDA to only use those GPUs that have peer-to-peer support. Alternatively, users can also set CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC to a non-zero value to force the driver to always use device memory for physical storage. When this environment variable is set to a non-zero value, all devices used in that process that support managed memory have to be peer-to-peer compatible with each other. The error \fBcudaErrorInvalidDevice\fP will be returned if a device that supports managed memory is used and it is not peer-to-peer compatible with any of the other managed memory supporting devices that were previously used in that process, even if \fBcudaDeviceReset\fP has been called on those devices. These environment variables are described in the CUDA programming guide under the 'CUDA environment variables' section.

Allocates at least \fCwidth\fP (in bytes) * \fCheight\fP bytes of linear memory on the device and returns in \fC*devPtr\fP a pointer to the allocated memory. The function may pad the allocation to ensure that corresponding pointers in any given row will continue to meet the alignment requirements for coalescing as the address is updated from row to row. The pitch returned in \fC*pitch\fP by \fBcudaMallocPitch()\fP is the width in bytes of the allocation. The intended usage of \fCpitch\fP is as a separate parameter of the allocation, used to compute addresses within the 2D array. Given the row and column of an array element of type \fCT\fP, the address is computed as: 
.PP
.nf
    T* pElement = (T*)((char*)BaseAddress + Row * pitch) + Column;

For allocations of 2D arrays, it is recommended that programmers consider performing pitch allocations using \fBcudaMallocPitch()\fP. Due to pitch alignment restrictions in the hardware, this is especially true if the application will be performing 2D memory copies between different regions of device memory (whether linear memory or CUDA arrays).

Advise the Unified Memory subsystem about the usage pattern for the memory range starting at \fCdevPtr\fP with a size of \fCcount\fP bytes. The start address and end address of the memory range will be rounded down and rounded up respectively to be aligned to CPU page size before the advice is applied. The memory range must refer to managed memory allocated via \fBcudaMallocManaged\fP or declared via __managed__ variables.
.PP
The \fCadvice\fP parameter can take the following values:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBcudaMemAdviseSetReadMostly\fP: This implies that the data is mostly going to be read from and only occasionally written to. Any read accesses from any processor to this region will create a read-only copy of at least the accessed pages in that processor's memory. Additionally, if \fBcudaMemPrefetchAsync\fP is called on this region, it will create a read-only copy of the data on the destination processor. If any processor writes to this region, all copies of the corresponding page will be invalidated except for the one where the write occurred. The \fCdevice\fP argument is ignored for this advice. Note that for a page to be read-duplicated, the accessing processor must either be the CPU or a GPU that has a non-zero value for the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP. Also, if a context is created on a device that does not have the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP set, then read-duplication will not occur until all such contexts are destroyed.
.IP "\(bu" 2
cudaMemAdviceUnsetReadMostly: Undoes the effect of cudaMemAdviceReadMostly and also prevents the Unified Memory driver from attempting heuristic read-duplication on the memory range. Any read-duplicated copies of the data will be collapsed into a single copy. The location for the collapsed copy will be the preferred location if the page has a preferred location and one of the read-duplicated copies was resident at that location. Otherwise, the location chosen is arbitrary.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBcudaMemAdviseSetPreferredLocation\fP: This advice sets the preferred location for the data to be the memory belonging to \fCdevice\fP. Passing in cudaCpuDeviceId for \fCdevice\fP sets the preferred location as host memory. If \fCdevice\fP is a GPU, then it must have a non-zero value for the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP. Setting the preferred location does not cause data to migrate to that location immediately. Instead, it guides the migration policy when a fault occurs on that memory region. If the data is already in its preferred location and the faulting processor can establish a mapping without requiring the data to be migrated, then data migration will be avoided. On the other hand, if the data is not in its preferred location or if a direct mapping cannot be established, then it will be migrated to the processor accessing it. It is important to note that setting the preferred location does not prevent data prefetching done using \fBcudaMemPrefetchAsync\fP. Having a preferred location can override the page thrash detection and resolution logic in the Unified Memory driver. Normally, if a page is detected to be constantly thrashing between for example host and device memory, the page may eventually be pinned to host memory by the Unified Memory driver. But if the preferred location is set as device memory, then the page will continue to thrash indefinitely. If \fBcudaMemAdviseSetReadMostly\fP is also set on this memory region or any subset of it, then the policies associated with that advice will override the policies of this advice.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBcudaMemAdviseUnsetPreferredLocation\fP: Undoes the effect of \fBcudaMemAdviseSetPreferredLocation\fP and changes the preferred location to none.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBcudaMemAdviseSetAccessedBy\fP: This advice implies that the data will be accessed by \fCdevice\fP. Passing in \fBcudaCpuDeviceId\fP for \fCdevice\fP will set the advice for the CPU. If \fCdevice\fP is a GPU, then the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP must be non-zero. This advice does not cause data migration and has no impact on the location of the data per se. Instead, it causes the data to always be mapped in the specified processor's page tables, as long as the location of the data permits a mapping to be established. If the data gets migrated for any reason, the mappings are updated accordingly. This advice is recommended in scenarios where data locality is not important, but avoiding faults is. Consider for example a system containing multiple GPUs with peer-to-peer access enabled, where the data located on one GPU is occasionally accessed by peer GPUs. In such scenarios, migrating data over to the other GPUs is not as important because the accesses are infrequent and the overhead of migration may be too high. But preventing faults can still help improve performance, and so having a mapping set up in advance is useful. Note that on CPU access of this data, the data may be migrated to host memory because the CPU typically cannot access device memory directly. Any GPU that had the cudaMemAdviceSetAccessedBy flag set for this data will now have its mapping updated to point to the page in host memory. If \fBcudaMemAdviseSetReadMostly\fP is also set on this memory region or any subset of it, then the policies associated with that advice will override the policies of this advice. Additionally, if the preferred location of this memory region or any subset of it is also \fCdevice\fP, then the policies associated with \fBcudaMemAdviseSetPreferredLocation\fP will override the policies of this advice.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBcudaMemAdviseUnsetAccessedBy\fP: Undoes the effect of \fBcudaMemAdviseSetAccessedBy\fP. Any mappings to the data from \fCdevice\fP may be removed at any time causing accesses to result in non-fatal page faults.

.SS "\fBcudaError_t\fP cudaMemPrefetchAsync (const void * devPtr, size_t count, int dstDevice, \fBcudaStream_t\fP stream = \fC0\fP)"
.PP
Prefetches memory to the specified destination device. \fCdevPtr\fP is the base device pointer of the memory to be prefetched and \fCdstDevice\fP is the destination device. \fCcount\fP specifies the number of bytes to copy. \fCstream\fP is the stream in which the operation is enqueued. The memory range must refer to managed memory allocated via \fBcudaMallocManaged\fP or declared via __managed__ variables.
.PP
Passing in cudaCpuDeviceId for \fCdstDevice\fP will prefetch the data to host memory. If \fCdstDevice\fP is a GPU, then the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP must be non-zero. Additionally, \fCstream\fP must be associated with a device that has a non-zero value for the device attribute \fBcudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess\fP.
.PP
The start address and end address of the memory range will be rounded down and rounded up respectively to be aligned to CPU page size before the prefetch operation is enqueued in the stream.
.PP
If no physical memory has been allocated for this region, then this memory region will be populated and mapped on the destination device. If there's insufficient memory to prefetch the desired region, the Unified Memory driver may evict pages from other \fBcudaMallocManaged\fP allocations to host memory in order to make room. Device memory allocated using \fBcudaMalloc\fP or \fBcudaMallocArray\fP will not be evicted.
.PP
By default, any mappings to the previous location of the migrated pages are removed and mappings for the new location are only setup on \fCdstDevice\fP. The exact behavior however also depends on the settings applied to this memory range via \fBcudaMemAdvise\fP as described below:
.PP
If \fBcudaMemAdviseSetReadMostly\fP was set on any subset of this memory range, then that subset will create a read-only copy of the pages on \fCdstDevice\fP.
.PP
If \fBcudaMemAdviseSetPreferredLocation\fP was called on any subset of this memory range, then the pages will be migrated to \fCdstDevice\fP even if \fCdstDevice\fP is not the preferred location of any pages in the memory range.
.PP
If \fBcudaMemAdviseSetAccessedBy\fP was called on any subset of this memory range, then mappings to those pages from all the appropriate processors are updated to refer to the new location if establishing such a mapping is possible. Otherwise, those mappings are cleared.
.PP
Note that this API is not required for functionality and only serves to improve performance by allowing the application to migrate data to a suitable location before it is accessed. Memory accesses to this range are always coherent and are allowed even when the data is actively being migrated.

Note that this function is asynchronous with respect to the host and all work on other devices.

\fBcudaMemRangeAttributePreferredLocation\fP: If this attribute is specified, \fCdata\fP will be interpreted as a 32-bit integer, and \fCdataSize\fP must be 4. The result returned will be a GPU device id if all pages in the memory range have that GPU as their preferred location, or it will be cudaCpuDeviceId if all pages in the memory range have the CPU as their preferred location, or it will be cudaInvalidDeviceId if either all the pages don't have the same preferred location or some of the pages don't have a preferred location at all. Note that the actual location of the pages in the memory range at the time of the query may be different from the preferred location.

\fBcudaMemRangeAttributeAccessedBy\fP: If this attribute is specified, \fCdata\fP will be interpreted as an array of 32-bit integers, and \fCdataSize\fP must be a non-zero multiple of 4. The result returned will be a list of device ids that had cudaMemAdviceSetAccessedBy set for that entire memory range. If any device does not have that advice set for the entire memory range, that device will not be included. If \fCdata\fP is larger than the number of devices that have that advice set for that memory range, cudaInvalidDeviceId will be returned in all the extra space provided. For ex., if \fCdataSize\fP is 12 (i.e. \fCdata\fP has 3 elements) and only device 0 has the advice set, then the result returned will be { 0, cudaInvalidDeviceId, cudaInvalidDeviceId }. If \fCdata\fP is smaller than the number of devices that have that advice set, then only as many devices will be returned as can fit in the array. There is no guarantee on which specific devices will be returned, however.

\fBcudaMemRangeAttributeLastPrefetchLocation\fP: If this attribute is specified, \fCdata\fP will be interpreted as a 32-bit integer, and \fCdataSize\fP must be 4. The result returned will be the last location to which all pages in the memory range were prefetched explicitly via \fBcudaMemPrefetchAsync\fP. This will either be a GPU id or cudaCpuDeviceId depending on whether the last location for prefetch was a GPU or the CPU respectively. If any page in the memory range was never explicitly prefetched or if all pages were not prefetched to the same location, cudaInvalidDeviceId will be returned. Note that this simply returns the last location that the applicaton requested to prefetch the memory range to. It gives no indication as to whether the prefetch operation to that location has completed or even begun.
