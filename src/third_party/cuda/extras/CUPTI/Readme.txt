README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CUDA Profiler Tools Interface (CUPTI) enables the creation of
profiling and tracing tools that target CUDA applications. CUPTI
provides a set of APIs targeted at ISVs creating profilers and other
performance optimization tools. The CUPTI APIs are not intended to be
used by developers in their CUDA applications.
